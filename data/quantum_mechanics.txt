Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales, such as atoms and subatomic particles. Unlike classical physics, which provides deterministic predictions, quantum mechanics is inherently probabilistic. It introduces concepts like wave-particle duality, where particles such as electrons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, cannot both be precisely known at the same time. Quantum mechanics also explains phenomena such as quantum tunneling, where particles can pass through energy barriers that would be insurmountable in classical physics. The theory has been confirmed by countless experiments and underpins much of modern technology, including semiconductors, lasers, and magnetic resonance imaging. Quantum mechanics is governed by mathematical equations such as the Schr√∂dinger equation, which describes how the quantum state of a system evolves over time. Despite its abstract nature and counterintuitive predictions, quantum mechanics remains one of the most successful and well-tested theories in science, providing deep insights into the nature of reality.
