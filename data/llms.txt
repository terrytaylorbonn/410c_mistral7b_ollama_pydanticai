# Simple RAG Demo Project

> A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built with Gradio that provides semantic search over local documents, featuring support for the llms.txt format as used by Vercel and the broader LLM community.

This demo system demonstrates how to build a simple document search interface that can handle various text formats including the structured llms.txt format. The system is designed to be deployed easily to platforms like Render while maintaining simplicity and effectiveness.

Key features:
- Simple semantic search over text documents
- Support for llms.txt format parsing and display
- Gradio-based web interface
- Cloud deployment ready (tested on Render)
- Minimal dependencies for reliable deployment
