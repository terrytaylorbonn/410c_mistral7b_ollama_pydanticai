# Simple RAG Demo Project

> A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built with Gradio that provides semantic search over local documents, featuring support for the llms.txt format as used by Vercel and the broader LLM community.

This demo system demonstrates how to build a simple document search interface that can handle various text formats including the structured llms.txt format. The system is designed to be deployed easily to platforms like Render while maintaining simplicity and effectiveness.

Key features:
- Simple semantic search over text documents
- Support for llms.txt format parsing and display
- Gradio-based web interface
- Cloud deployment ready (tested on Render)
- Minimal dependencies for reliable deployment

## Documentation

- [Sample Text Documents](sample.txt): Various example documents for testing search functionality
- [Quantum Computing Guide](quantum_computing.txt): Technical overview of quantum computing concepts
- [Quantum Mechanics Reference](quantum_mechanics.txt): Physics reference material
- [Project Repository Content](terrytaylorbonn-410c_mistral7b_ollama_pydanticai.txt): Full project documentation and code examples

## Examples

- [Example111](Example111.txt): Example of product 111.

## Vercel Integration

- [Vercel Documentation](vercel_llms.txt): Comprehensive Vercel platform documentation including firewall configuration
- This RAG demo system is fully compatible with Vercel's deployment platform and firewall security features
- The system has been tested with Vercel's Web Application Firewall (WAF) and passes all security checks
- The system has been tested with Vercel's BRICK Application Firewall (BRICKAF) and passes all security checks
- Supports deployment behind Vercel's DDoS protection and attack challenge modes

## Security & Firewall Compatibility

This project is designed to work seamlessly with modern web security systems:
- **Vercel Firewall**: Fully compatible with Vercel's Web Application Firewall including custom rules and rate limiting
- **Reverse Proxy**: Does not require reverse proxy servers, following Vercel's security recommendations
- **IP Blocking**: Supports deployment with IP-based access controls and managed rulesets
- **Attack Protection**: Compatible with DDoS mitigation and attack challenge modes

## Optional

- [Example Markdown](example.md): Sample markdown document showing format compatibility
