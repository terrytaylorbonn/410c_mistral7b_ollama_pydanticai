- Windows (via WSL2)
- Docker (planned)

## [0.9.0] - Development Phase

### Development History
- Initial project conception and architecture design
- Core RAG system prototype development
- Ollama integration and testing
- Multi-agent system design and implementation
- OpenAI integration for quality comparison
- GitIngest integration and workflow development
- Comprehensive testing on WSL2/Ubuntu environment
- Documentation creation and refinement

### Key Milestones
- ✅ Local RAG system working with ChromaDB
- ✅ Mistral 7B integration via Ollama
- ✅ Multi-agent communication established
- ✅ OpenAI comparison functionality
- ✅ GitIngest workflow integration
- ✅ Complete documentation suite
- ✅ Error handling and robustness testing

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- GitIngest API occasionally returns 422 errors (web interface recommended)
- Large models require significant RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- First-time model downloads can be slow
- Vector database rebuilding required when adding many documents

### Workarounds
- Use GitIngest web interface for reliable repository processing
- Use phi3:mini model for lower resource environments
- Pre-download models during setup phase
- Implement incremental document indexing

## Migration Guide

### From Development to v1.0.0
No migration needed - this is the initial release.

### Future Migrations
Migration guides will be provided for breaking changes in future versions.

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Measures
- Environment variable protection for API keys
- Local-only operation by default
- No data transmission to external services (except OpenAI/GitIngest when explicitly used)
- .gitignore protection for sensitive files

### Security Best Practices
- Keep API keys secure and never commit to version control
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Consider network security when deploying agents

## Performance Notes

### Optimization History
- Initial implementation focused on functionality
- Added streaming support for better user experience
- Implemented retry logic for reliability
- Optimized for USB SSD and slower hardware
- Added configurable timeouts and error handling

### Benchmark Results
- Local RAG queries: 1-5 seconds (depending on document size)
- Agent communication: 0.5-2 seconds
- Model inference: 2-10 seconds (varies by model and hardware)
- Document indexing: Proportional to document size and count
